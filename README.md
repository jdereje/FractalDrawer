# FractalDrawer

 This project was completed as apart of a Data Structures and Algorthims Course.The objective was to create a 
	
 Java program that utilizes a visual "canvas" to display fractal triangles, circles, and rectangles. The 
	
 "Canvas" class extends the Applet class, which is a built-in Java class for creating applets, or small 
	
 programs that run in a web browser. The Applet class was used to create the Frame object, which serves 
	
 as the top-level window for the program and provides a title bar and other standard window features. 
	
 The program uses a combination of recursive algorithms and graphics libraries to generate and render 
	
 the fractal shapes on the canvas.
