# FractalDrawer

Creating Fractal Designs in Java using OOP

## Description

 This project was completed as part of an Algorithms and Data Structures course. The objective was to create a 
 Java program that utilizes a visual "canvas" to display fractal triangles, circles, and rectangles. The 
 "Canvas" class extends the Applet class, which is a built-in Java class for creating applets, or small 
 programs that run in a web browser. The Applet class was used to create the Frame object, which serves 
 as the top-level window for the program and provides a title bar and other standard window features. 
 The program uses a combination of recursive algorithms and graphics libraries to generate and render 
 the fractal shapes on the canvas.
